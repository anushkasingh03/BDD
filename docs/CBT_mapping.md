# CBT Mapping

| Scenario | Core distortion | CBT target | Sample feedback |
|----------|-----------------|------------|-----------------|
| Mirror Check before party | Catastrophizing, all-or-nothing | Cognitive restructuring, evidence logging | "I can tell the mirror is pulling you into a harsh story. What facts support this thought?" |
| Social Media Scroll | Mental filtering | Mindful disengagement, values re-alignment | "Notice how the feed cherry-picks highlights. What else might be true?" |
| Gym Changing Room | Body comparison | Self-compassion, behavioral experiment | "Try a grounder: list three body functions you're grateful for before walking out." |
| Video Call Preview | Perfectionism | Exposure with response prevention | "Instead of hiding, try joining as-is and track what happens, not what you fear." |

CBT scripts live in `src/game/feedback_templates.json` and are referenced by scenario + sentiment zone tags.
